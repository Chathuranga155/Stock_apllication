# Stock Application

## Project Overview

This Stock Application is a web-based platform developed as part of my first-year, last-semester project. It is designed to help users manage stock levels, monitor inventory, and perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products. The application utilizes a modern tech stack, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and Bootstrap, to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Dashboard:** A central place to view stock levels and recent activity.
- **Product Management:** Add, edit, view, and delete products in the inventory.
- **Stock Monitoring:** Real-time updates on stock levels with alerts for low stock items.
- **Search Functionality:** Quickly search for products by name or category.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various devices using Bootstrap.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system for authorized access.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Structure and layout of the web pages.
- **CSS3:** Styling of the application, including custom styles and Bootstrap.
- **JavaScript:** Client-side scripting for dynamic content and form validation.
- **PHP:** Server-side scripting to handle database interactions and business logic.
- **MySQL:** Database management system to store product information and user data.
- **Bootstrap:** Responsive design framework for mobile-first development.
